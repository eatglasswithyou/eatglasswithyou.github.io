                    <h3>The time until <span class="text-primary">Bori</span></h3>
                    <p>Before the council, before Bori came to this land, the area was two separate kingdoms, warring with one another. The mightiest of all was the Hillands. The Hilland was ruled at the time by the cruel tyrant Edgar. Edgar Tabrizi eventually conquered the northern realm, and took the opposing king's daughter as a wife, Regina. Regina was already in love with the man who would become Bori, captain of her father's guard. Bori was a kind and just man who believed in freedom and good will towards all.</p>
                    <p>He publicly challenged Edgar to a fight, and being a prideful man, Edgar accepted. Being a deceitful man, he also cheated. As he began to lose the combat, Edgar had arranged for his servants to threaten the life of Regina to force Bori to throw the fight. Bori agreed to throw the fight, but Regina was killed anyway. witnessing the death of his beloved, Bori grew so powerful he became a God and slay Edgar where he stood. This is how the <b>Wychwood</b> came to be, as Bori's anger destroyed all life within the nearby woods.</p>
                    <p>Bori became the new ruler of the realm and in witnessing his goodness and power, became the primary god of the region.
                    <h3><span class="text-primary">Boriell</span> Today</h3>
                    <p>Boriell is ruled by a council of elders called "The Four" each chosen at birth by as a reincarnation of his spirit. When the old dies, a new one is born, and a search begins for the new member. Each of the four oversees an area directly, as indicated above, and this is where the new child is born.
